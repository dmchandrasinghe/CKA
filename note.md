# Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration

## Understand Kubernetes components and architecture
Basic Micro serice architecure:
  1. Codebase: Maintain one codebase per application, tracked in version control. This helps manage changes, rollbacks, and collaboration effectively.

  2. Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies. Use package managers to define dependencies and avoid relying on system-wide dependencies.

  3. Config: Store configuration in the environment. Keep configurations (like credentials, API keys, etc.) separate from code, allowing easy configuration changes without code modifications.

  4. Backing services: Treat backing services (databases, caches, etc.) as attached resources. Access them via environment variables or service discovery mechanisms.

  5. Build, release, run: Strictly separate build, release, and run stages. Maintain a clear distinction between building the app, releasing it to a specific environment, and running it in that environment.

  6. Processes: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. Applications should be designed to be stateless, share-nothing processes that can start and stop gracefully.

  7. Port binding: Export services via port binding. Services should be self-contained and expose themselves via a port, allowing them to be easily connected to the outside world.

  8. Concurrency: Scale out via the process model. Scale by running multiple processes and scaling horizontally rather than vertically by increasing the resources of a single instance.

  9. Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown. Apps should be able to start up quickly and shut down gracefully, handling sudden failures or updates seamlessly.

  10. Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible. Reducing discrepancies between environments minimizes bugs and deployment issues.

  11. Logs: Treat logs as event streams. Applications should generate logs as event streams and leave log management and analysis to external tools.

  12. Admin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes. Provide a way to run administrative or maintenance tasks separately from the main application.

k8s designed to support all abov factors. kubetes have diffrenct componetes to cater each requirement as below.

1. Kubernetes Control Plane:

    API Server: Accepts and processes requests from users and other components.

    Controller Manager: Monitors the state of the cluster and takes corrective
actions.

        * Scheduler: Assigns pods to worker nodes

        * etcd: Stores the cluster state

2. Kubernetes Worker Nodes:
    Run containerized applications (pods).
    Managed by the control plane.
    Communicate with the control plane via the kubelet agent.

3. Pods:
    The basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes.
    Group one or more containers and shared storage.
    Scheduled to run on worker nodes.

4. Deployments:
    Manage the creation and scaling of pods.
    Define a desired state for a set of pods.
    Kubernetes automatically creates or deletes pods to match the desired state.

5. Services:
    Provide a stable endpoint for pods.
    Load balance traffic across pods in a set.
    Can be exposed internally or externally to the cluster.

6. Namespaces:
    Logical partitions of a Kubernetes cluster.
    Isolate resources and prevent conflicts between applications.

7. Networking:

    Pods can communicate with each other using IP addresses or DNS names.
    Services provide a single point of access for pods.
    Ingress controllers allow external traffic to reach pods.

8. Storage:

    Persistent storage can be attached to pods using PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.
    Different storage classes can be used to provision different types of storage.

9. Security:

    Kubernetes provides role-based access control (RBAC) to control access to the cluster.
    Pods can be run with security contexts to limit their privileges.
    Network policies can be used to control traffic between pods.

10. Lables

    simply key value pairs
    use to metion or describe resource (pods, nodes) own sparticular group

11. Selectors

    filter pods using lables apply function (network policy, deployments).

12. workloads

    type of workload :  

      * replica-sets : maintain the set of pods as metions in pod yaml

      * deployment : create pods
        deployment --> replicaSet --> Pods

      * daemonSet :  create pods in each node in the cluster (onitoring agent,log tools)

      * StatefulSet :
            Maintain state of pods even in recreated. Usefull when creating clustered applications (Database, Redis, etc).

          * pods need persitant state (ex: map storage to pod)
          * start pods in ordered list

      * Jobs : Pod need run and stop do specific task

      * cronjobs : same as job but execute as defined schedule

13. Services

    access the pods using unifed method. create single interface to all the pods which serve single task.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      # Optional field
      # By default and for convenience, the Kubernetes control plane will allocate a port from a range (default: 30000-32767)
      nodePort: 30007
```

how to call service

`<service name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

type of services to communicate

1. CLsuterIP :
commubicate with in the cluster using pod networking

metadata:
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080 # app's container port
      nodePort: 30000 # pecify a specific nodePort or Kubernetes will assign one

```

3. LoadBalancer : distributes incoming traffic among your app's pods and is cloud-provider-specific. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:

```yaml
apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata: 
  name: example-externalName
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: rds.aws.com
```
5. Ingress : <br>
API object manage external acess to the internal services by defining and enforcing routing rules for incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic,
Popular tools like nginx, HAProxy. Ingress controller can
  * Route traffic to internal service by path base or name base routing
  * ssl terminate
  *   
 ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:

etcd Backup & Restore Operations

# Workloads & Scheduling

## Understand deployments and how to perform rolling update and rollbacks

Kubernetes Deployment ensures that an application has a minimum number of replicas running at all times. In the event that a replica fails, the Kubernetes API ensures that a new one is created within minutes.

In the Exam , you should know how to do rollbacks and rollouts of deployments.

Kubernetes Deployment Concepts
  
  1. Recreate [native]
  2. Ramped [native] [default]
      * ramp update or rolling update 
  3. Blue/Green
      * red/black deployment, create new version traffic route instantly.this can be done by changing serive selector label patching once version 2 created. easy to rollback and rollforward. high resource utilization 

  4. Canary
      * same as ramped update change route to percentage of traffic.can do this by create pods count as per percentage each versions. then use same service for both version. this can be done with service mesh like [Istio] 

  5. A/B Testing
      * route traffic to rach version base on incomming traffic meta data like device type, geo location, user type, 

  6. Shadow
      * mirrot version doesnt activly respond in mirror state. use test application load testing, application behaviour error without impact to users.

Kubernetes Rolling Update

## Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to configure applications

Configmaps in Kubernetes are useful for storing non-critical data in key-value pair format. They can also be used to inject environment variables into pods.

In the Exam , you should knwo how to use configmaps and secrets objects to create, modify, and delete variables and secrets and make them available to a pod.

Kubernetes Configmap Concepts
Kubernetes Secrets Concepts

## Know how to scale applications

Kubernetes offers a variety of ways to scale applications, including the use of deployment objects to increase the number of replicas of your application.

Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) can be used to increase the number of replicas based on application metrics.

For the Exam , you should be able to scale a pod/deployment. You can follow this tutorial.

Working With Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

### autoscaling
  auto scale pod or cluster size base on metrics.simply use basics metrics like cpu , memory but can use external metrics like messege queue size, object type kind of metrics using external adapters.
  1. HPA
  2. Cluster autoscale

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: cpu_mem_hpa
  label:
    site: zone
    env: prod
spec:
  maxReplicas: 10
  minReplicas: 1
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: node-app
  metrics:
    -type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          everrageUtilizationL: 75
    type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          everrageUtilizationL: 75
```
This HPA auto scale pod count base on. But only node have limitations of maximum pods count. then we need clsuter autoscalaer.
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: zone-prod-autoscaler
spec:
  scaleUp:
    policies:
      - name: zone-prod-cluster-scale-up-policy
        nodeSelector:
          matchLabels:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" #this lable use to apply only for worker nodes in cluster
        limits:
          cpu: "2000m"
          memory: "4Gi"
        delta: 3
        enabled: true
  scaleDown:
    policies:
      - name: cluster-scale-down-policy
        nodeSelector:
          matchLabels:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" #this lable use to apply only for worker nodes in cluster
        limits:
          cpu: "1000m"
          memory: "2Gi"
        delta: 3
        enabled: true

```



## Understand the primitives used to create robust, self-healing, application deployments

For any self-healing application, you should use deployments or stateful sets so that when pods fail, Kubernetes instantly recreates them.

Deployments also allow you to keep track of all the changes you make. You can also easily return to a previous state.

Kubernetes Deployments

## Understand how resource limits can affect Pod scheduling

Cluster management also includes workload management; as an administrator, you should ensure that each pod has access to resources based on its requirements.

Each pod in kubernetes can be assigned a minimum and maximum CPU and memory usage.

* Manage Container Resources
* Pods with resource requests

You can use any of the following methods to choose where Kubernetes schedules specific Pods:

* <code>nodeSelector</code> field matching against node labels
* Affinity and anti-affinity
* nodeName field
* Pod topology spread constraints (taints and tollerents)


### node selector
simplest recommended form of node selection
lable k8s node with ssd label
```bash
kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> disktype=ssd
```
deploy pod to clsuter with selector
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd

```



## Awareness of manifest management and common templating tools

This section assumes youâ€™re familiar with tools like kustomization, helm, and so on.

In general , during the Exam , you should be able to create, modify and apply Kubernetes manifests

# Services & Networking

## Understand host networking configuration on the cluster nodes

Kube-proxy is a component that must be installed on each worker node in order for pods to communicate with one another. Kube proxy participation is required for node networking.

Kubelet is the process by which a worker node communicates with the master node. All of these concepts are required to comprehend networking within Kubernetes.

Kubernetes Networking

## Understand connectivity between Pods

Pods communicate with one another via services. This is made possible by the Kube proxy component.

Understand Kube Proxy

## Understand ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer service types and endpoints

Understanding each service type and their use cases is critical. Understanding how pods can be added to a service should be given special consideration.

Kubernetes Service

## Know how to configure and use CoreDNS

CoreDNS is a highly adaptable and extensible DNS server that can act as the Kubernetes cluster DNS. The CNCF hosts the CoreDNS project, as it does Kubernetes.

Using CoreDNS for Service Discovery

## Choose an appropriate container network interface plugin

The Container Networking Interface (CNI) aims to develop a generic plugin-based networking solution for containers.

For the Exam , you should Know how to choose a CNI according to your needs.

There are numerous options, including Flannel, Calico, and others.

Kubernetes Network Plugins
The network section accounts for 20% of the examâ€™s content. Youâ€™ll almost certainly be asked to create at least one network policy, endpoint, or ingress.

# Troubleshooting

## Evaluate cluster and node logging

Application logs can aid in understanding the applicationâ€™s activities and status. The logs are especially useful for troubleshooting and monitoring cluster activity.

Examining logs of Kubernetes control plane components such as etcd and the scheduler can also be very beneficial.

  ### Kubernetes Logging
  by default k8s support get logs from stdout and stderr in container runtime. kublet writes those logs in persistant location(/var/log) in each node. agents in each node(can collet logs and sent log store/processor to keep logs.

example :
agent deply in eachcnode using daemonset deploymebnt

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: filebeat-config
  namespace: zone-prod
data:
  filebeat.yml: |-
    filebeat.inputs:
    - type: container
      paths:
        - /var/log/pods/*/*.log
      processors:
        - add_kubernetes_metadata:
            in_cluster: true

    output.elasticsearch:
      hosts: ["elasticsearch.zone-prod.svc.cluster.local:9200"]
      username: "username"
      password: "password"

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet

        image: docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:latest
        args: [
          "-c", "/etc/filebeat.yml",
          "-e",
        ]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: filebeat-config
          mountPath: /etc/filebeat.yml
          subPath: filebeat.yml
        - name: varlogpods
          mountPath: /var/log/pods
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: filebeat-config
        configMap:
          name: filebeat-config
      - name: varlogpods
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log/pods

```
  deploy elastic search to store/process

create elastic search service

        env:
        - name: discovery.type
          value: single-node  # For a single-node setup, can be changed for multi-node

```


## Understand how to monitor applications

Monitoring applications can be accomplished by storing logs and analyzing application metrics.

Tools like Prometheus and Grafana are popular because they make metric management simple.

Monitoring & Logging & Debugging

  Prometheus :
      pull base target monitoring. use pushgateway to monitor short-lived targets like jobs 

## Manage container stdout & stderr logs

Create Logging agent (stdeout & stderr )

## Troubleshoot application failure

Administrators should also assist users in debugging applications that have been deployed into Kubernetes but are not behaving correctly.

Understanding Kubernetes Logging
Debug Kubernetes Objects

## Troubleshoot cluster component failure

When users are confident that their application is properly configured, cluster components must be debugged and troubleshooted for failures.

Debug Kubernetes Cluster

## Troubleshoot networking

There may be instances where things go wrong on the network end, such as incorrect configuration of ingress resources.
